- 👋 Hi, I’m @freetrade7
- 👀 I’m interested in getting basic understanding of multiple languages and frameworks, so that I could understand what our dev team is working on
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, Swift, HTML, CSS
- 💞️ I kick for me was when I realized that one of the websites i built with Wix vietnamballoons.com has very limited to ability to support DB. Our current project needs to works with DBs a lot, thus diving deeper into all this programming thing, and I love it!
- 📫 How to reach me: freetrade7@gmail.com
